              People dreaded a German invasion. Most people believe pillboxes were developed during World War II. However they were actually built to combat fears of invasion in susceptible places during World War I.

              During the war, 700,000 women entered the labour sector, and women progressively entered occupations that were previously controlled by men. By the end of the war, almost 700,000 people worked in metals and chemicals, the vast majority of whom produced bombs. One very evident result of this shift was the increased acceptance of pants as a piece of women's apparel.

              Tanks were initially utilised at the Battle of the Somme. David Lloyd George, the Minister of munitions, remarked in 1915 that 'this is an engineer's war. In the same year, Fosters of Lincoln, a business of agricultural equipment makers and engineers, was awarded the contract to produce a new weapon, the tank, for which there were high expectations.
On September 15, 1916, only 49 tanks were deployed on the Somme, the weapon's initial usage on the battlefield, but by November 1917, over 400 tanks had been deployed at the Battle of Cambrai, the first substantial use of tanks in combat.
During the First World War, Britain constructed almost 3,000 tanks.

              WWI was one of the deadliest wars in history, with an estimated 9 million troops killed and 23 million injured, as well as 5 million civilian deaths from a variety of causes. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the conflict played a significant role in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.

              Britain replied by producing many 'war gases' in various areas across England, and in Banbury, a local engineering firm developed a mechanism for filling mustard gas shells. The earthwork remains of the National Filling Factory in Banbury, as well as the circular gas-testing trench at Idmiston Down in Wiltshire, are designated as scheduled monuments.

              Major breakthroughs in prosthetics were developed during the war, as many servicemen lost limbs or were horribly maimed. Major breakthroughs in prosthetics were developed during the war, as many servicemen lost limbs or were horribly maimed. This resulted in significant improvements in the development and production of prosthetic limbs, as well as pioneering plastic surgery.

              Millions of Germans were imprisoned and slaughtered because they did not meet the stereotype of the 'ideal' German. Hitler desired to establish the "best" and strongest race, which, according to the Nazi Party, eliminated certain groups such as Jews, Gipsies, and those with physical and mental problems. In order to destroy a "racial enemy" outside of Germany, such groups were persecuted in the nations invaded by German troops.

              The Nazis mostly targeted Jews. Approximately six million Jews were massacred during World War II in one of history's most heinous catastrophes, the Holocaust. Hitler, who held racist ideas, blamed Jewish people for Germany's defeat in World War I and felt they were a threat to Germans and society.

              Some countries stayed 'neutral' in World War II. Such countries included Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, which elected not to join either side.

              The Germans surrendered on May 8, 1945. In 1944, an allied army crossed from Britain to liberate France from Nazi tyranny. One year later, allied forces invaded Germany and forced the Germans to capitulate. Following nuclear bombs on Japan's largest cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered to Allied forces in August of the same year. World War II had concluded.
