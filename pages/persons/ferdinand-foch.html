        <div class="person__text">Ferdinand Foch (October 2, 1851–March 20, 1929) was the Marshal of France and leader of all allied troops in the last months of World War I. Foch was a commander at the Battle of the Marne and Assistant Commander-in-Chief of France's Northern Army under General Joseph Joffre during the Somme Wars, but Joffre dismissed him from leadership due to his aggressive tactics and high casualty rates. Foch's recall and appointment to General Chief of Staff followed Joffre's dismissal from leadership in 1916. In March 1918, a conference of British and French officers and diplomats selected Foch Generalissime, or Supreme Commander of Allied Armies, to improve coordination among all forces on the Western Front. During the Hundred Days’ attacking, Foch and British Marshal Douglas Haig planned the Grand Offensive, which consisted of a series of overlapping attacking waves on German lines. This eventually resulted to the collapse of the German Hindenburg Line and the Armistice on November 11, 1918. Some historians believe him to be the most responsible leader for the Allied victory.</div>
