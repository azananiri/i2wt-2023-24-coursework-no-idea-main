        <div class="person__text">Gavrilo Princip (July 25, 1894 â€“ April 28, 1918) was a Bosnian Serb who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo. Princip was motivated by nationalistic and separatist aspirations, and he aimed to free the Balkans' Southern Slavic peoples from Austrian domination. The assassination of Austria's heir to the throne prompted Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, resulting in a flood of military alliances across Europe and the outbreak of World War I. Princip and his associates from the nationalist organisation, the Black Hand, were captured, tried, and convicted of murder. Princip was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but he died nearly four years later from the disease.</div>
