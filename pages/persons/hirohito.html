        <div class="person__text">Hirohito was Emperor of Japan from 1926 until his death in 1989. Despite the power of Japan's military chiefs, many experts believe Hirohito actively led the country and shaped its fighting strategy during World War II. Despite Japan's loss, he was allowed to retain his role as emperor, albeit mostly as a figurehead, while the country was under US occupation. Although many countries supported it, Hirohito was never prosecuted for war crimes.</div>
