        <div class="person__text">Vladimir Lenin (April 22, 1870 â€“ January 21, 1924) was a politician and revolutionary who eventually took control of the Russian government in 1917. Lenin was staunchly opposed to World War I, viewing it as an imperialist-capitalist battle. The February Revolution began in St. Petersburg in February 1917, when industrial war workers went on strike due to domestic food shortages. Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, and a Provisional Government began transforming the Empire into a new Russian Republic. Lenin was a key figure in the October Revolution of 1917, which deposed the Provisional Government and formed the new Communist Party. When Lenin took office, he believed that his new government should withdraw from World War I and seek an armistice with Germany. On March 3, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. Russia suffered huge territorial losses, losing 26% of its people, 37% of its agricultural harvest area, 28% of its industry, 26% of its railways, and two thirds of its coal and iron reserves to Germany. This contract proved to the Allied Powers that if Germany won the Western Front, it would demand severe peace terms.</div>
