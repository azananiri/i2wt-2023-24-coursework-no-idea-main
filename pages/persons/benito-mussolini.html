        <div class="person__text">Benito Mussolini, Italy's fascist prime minister, took office in 1922 and reigned as an absolute dictator. In many ways, Mussolini inspired Adolf Hitler, with whom he chose to align himself during World War II. Mussolini was deposed in a coup staged by some of his subordinates in 1943, and he was murdered by Italian partisans in 1945, just before the end of the European War.</div>
