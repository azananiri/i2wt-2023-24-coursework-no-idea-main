        <div class="person__text">Douglas Haig (June 19, 1861–January 29, 1928) was named commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in 1915. Haig directed the Somme assault, which began on July 1, 1916, in an attempt to break the Western Front stalemate and relieve pressure on the French army near Verdun. The British army suffered 60,000 casualties on the first day, the greatest in British history, and Haig's tactics made him one of the most divisive characters of the war. The nomination of Ferdinand Foch as Commander-in-Chief of allied troops, which Haig enthusiastically backed, united the French and British troops (later joined by the American Expeditionary Forces) under closer integrated command. During the Hundred Days’ attacking, Foch and Haig worked together on the Grand Offensive, which consisted of overlapping attacking waves against German lines. Between September and November 1918, Haig's BEF won a series of critical successes over the German army, eventually collapsing the German Hindenburg Line and forcing the Armistice on November 11, 1918. After the war, Haig helped form the Royal British Legion and was named an earl in 1919.</div>
