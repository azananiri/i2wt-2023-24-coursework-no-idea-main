        <div class="person__text">John Pershing (September 13, 1860 - July 15, 1948) was a United States Army general who led the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), along with French and British forces, to victory over Germany during World War I. After his force landed in Europe in 1917, he refused British and French attempts to integrate American soldiers into their armies, insisting that the AEF function as a single entity under his command. He eventually led the AEF to decisive wins at Cantigny, St. Mihiel, Chateau-Thierry, and the Meuse-Argonne. Pershing is the only American to be promoted to General of the Armies, the army's highest rank, while still alive. His bold frontal attack tactics were condemned by both other commanders at the time and subsequent historians for resulting in excessively high American deaths. In addition to commanding the AEF to victory in World War I, Pershing mentored several commanders who went on to become general in World War II, including George C. Marshall, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, George S. Patton, and Douglas MacArthur.</div>
