        <div class="person__text">Nicholas II (May 6, 1868â€“July 16, 1918) was a member of the Romanov royal family and the final Russian emperor from 1894 to 1917. As head of state, Nicholas supported Russia's mobilisation in defence of Serbia against Austria-Hungary in late July 1914, prompting Germany to declare war on Russia on August 1. Ultimately, around 3.3 million Russians were slaughtered during World War I. These massive losses, along with Russian commanders' inept tactics, as well as domestic food and supply shortages, were the primary factors of the Romanov dynasty's downfall. In 1915, Nicholas removed his most popular general and took command of all the troops himself. His departure, however, provided an opportunity for Nicholas's foes, both Bolsheviks and republicans, to plot his downfall. Following the February Revolution of 1917, Nicholas abdicated and was imprisoned, along with his family. The Bolsheviks killed the whole Royal Family on the night of July 16, 1918.</div>
