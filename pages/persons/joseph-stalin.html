        <div class="person__text">From 1922 until his death in 1953, Joseph Stalin served as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In some aspects, Stalin was to blame for the USSR's heavy losses at the start of World War II, as he ignored his advisors' warnings and refused to enable the Russian military to organise an adequate defence. At the same time, he was successful in keeping the country together and encouraging his people to mount a massive resistance to Germany, which eventually forced a German withdrawal. Stalin's dictatorship in the USSR was in many ways as ruthless as the Nazi system, and the alliance between Stalin and the Western Allies was always weak due to mutual suspicion.</div>
