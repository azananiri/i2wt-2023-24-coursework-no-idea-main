        <div class="person__text">Wilhelm II, sometimes known as William II, was the final German Emperor or "Kaiser" from June 15, 1888, to his abdication on November 9, 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria and was linked to numerous European kings. After being crowned, he set Germany on a "New Course" in politics, putting more power in the hands of the Kaiser rather than seasoned advisors and diplomats, resulting in an increasingly unstable state. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in July 1914 triggered a series of diplomatic problems involving Serbia, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. Russia's declaration of war against Germany's partner Austria-Hungary prompted Wilhelm to honour the alliance by declaring war on Russia and its ally, France. This set of events marked the beginning of the World War. Wilhelm II eventually lost army support and abdicated in November 1918, when the Western Front armistice was signed, fleeing to exile in the Netherlands. He never returned to Germany before his death in 1941.</div>
