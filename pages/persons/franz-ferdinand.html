        <div class="person__text">Franz Ferdinand (December 18, 1863 - June 28, 1914) was Archduke of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia, and the presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne from 1896 until his death. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was overextended and plagued by nationalist upheaval, particularly in the ethnically and religiously varied Balkan region. In 1914, the Archduke went to Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to evaluate the troops and discuss nationalist concerns. He and his wife, Sophie, were slain in their car by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian nationalist group the Black Hand. This action prompted Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, which triggered the events that led to World War I. Russia's military involvement on Serbia's behalf compelled Germany to act on its military alliance with Austria-Hungary, triggering a chain of diplomatic events that eventually led to World War I.</div>
