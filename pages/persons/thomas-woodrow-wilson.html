        <div class="person__text">Thomas Woodrow Wilson (December 28, 1856 - February 3, 1924) was a professor at Princeton University (eventually becoming president in 1902) and Governor of New Jersey before being elected president in 1912. When Europe fell into war in 1914, Wilson steadfastly maintained American neutrality. Wilson narrowly gained re-election in 1916, campaigning on the slogan "He kept us out of war." However, Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against American ships in the Atlantic, the Zimmermann telegram, and the Russian Revolution persuaded Wilson that neutrality was no longer an option. In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress to declare war. Wilson established a number of new offices and commissions, notably the Committee on Public Information and the United States Food Administration, to prepare both the military and the home front for war. Wilson presented his "Fourteen Points," a set of diplomatic ideas for global peace, to the Paris Peace Conference after the war ended. Many of Wilson's suggestions were included in the final Treaty of Versailles, which was not supported by the Republican-controlled US Congress. Wilson went on a nationwide tour to rally public support for the pact, but was tired by the tour's demanding schedule and suffered a near-fatal stroke. Wilson received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1920 for his efforts to promote international peace.</div>
