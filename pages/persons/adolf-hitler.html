        <div class="person__text">Adolf Hitler served as Germany's chancellor and self-proclaimed FÃ¼hrer, or "leader", from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. Hitler rose quickly to political prominence as the leader of the far-right Nazi Party in the 1920s, gaining total power and maintaining it during his tenure as chancellor. During his reign, he played an active role in Germany's government, making military decisions and enforcing edicts concerning the treatment of Jews and other minorities, such as the notorious "final solution" that condemned Jews to death in concentration camps in German-controlled parts of Europe. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide in their Berlin bunker shortly before Germany surrendered in 1945.</div>
